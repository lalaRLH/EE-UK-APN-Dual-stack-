Mobileconfig is for EE in the UK. 

Where EE issue only an IPv6 address, many services (eg Play Station Portable), older games, certain websites etc only support IPv4.
- In paticular, when hotspotting many devices expect an IPv4 address and will report "no internet" if they only get an IPv6 address.

When attempting to fix this I kept finding myself sent to an archaic, very old mobileconfig file that blocked IPv6 entirely. This seemed like a bad "fix."
... so I made a profile myself that has both IPv4 and IPv6 at once. 
Now we have the best of both worlds.
